            <h2>Mobile Header Menu</h2>
            <p>Your task will be to create mobile menu, common called as 'hamburger menu'.</p>
            <p>This menu has already created HTML construction. Every one of you have to add JS and CSS code to make this menu functional.</p>
            <p>You can change HTML if you think this is necessary. Also, you can use any tool or plugin.</p>
            <h3>Rules:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Menu is accessable from red button placed in header.</li>
                <li>Header is fixed and have to always visible. When menu is opened, it should bo below header.</li>
                <li>Menu should have fixed position too. You could open it from any position (scroll position) of page.</li>
                <li>If menu is shorter than screen height, rest of screen should have black background with 80% of transparency.</li>
                <li>Menu has 2 levels of nesting. Some elements have own submenus. Only one submenu can be visibe. Opening one of submenus should close rest submenus.</li>
                <li>If menu is heigher than window height, user should have possibility to scroll it. Menu should go under header if this is necessary.</li>
                <li>If menu is opened, user <b>have to</b> have blocked scrolling of rest page. Only element of menu can be scrolled if it's opened.</li>
            </ol>
